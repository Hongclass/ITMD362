# Production Problem 3: Baseline Form Styles

## The Problem

Find the HTML form in the `index.html` file in this directory. First, set it up to correctly accept the information called for in the <label> elements, and ensure that the HTML is valid.

Then, create a set of baseline, mobile-first styles that make this form easy to fill out on a mobile phone. You should begin by including reset styles.

Select for the form a CSS font stack based on commonly available system fonts. Then, enhance your font stack by loading and applying a Google font face that you think works well for form inputs.

Bonus points for loading the Google font via both JavaScript, with a CSS-only fallback.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that showcase your work on:

* Improvements to the form HTML in the `index.html` file in this directory (`week-04`); be sure
  to run it through the HTML validator at http://validator.w3.org/ to make sure it's valid HTML
  (it deliberately contains a number of errors that you must fix).

* Baseline, mobile-first form styles, including reset styles, in a `screen.css` file that you must
  create.
