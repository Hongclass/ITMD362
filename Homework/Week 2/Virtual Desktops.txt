Virtual Desktops

I use Windwos 10 as my operating sytem. Windwos 10 adds a new function which is Virtual Desktops. Now, I can use mouse to create multiple Virtual Desktops. 
Step 1: 
Use mouse to click Task View as the picture, Virtual Desktops - step 1.jpg showing. 
Step 2:
Add new desktop as the picture, Virtual Desktops - step 2.jpg showing.
Step 3:
Manage these three multiple Virtual Desktops. 
The first one has the apps of my everyday web browser, Chrome and my usually using apps. 
The second one has the apps of command-line shell and text editor. 
The third one has the app of my develpment browser, Firefox. 

Now is the time for keyboard operation. 
Command for creating a new virtual desktop and switch to it: Windows Key + Ctrl + D.
Command for closing the current virtual desktop: Windows Key + Ctrl + F4.
Command for viewing whole three Virtual Desktops: Windows Key + Tab.
Command for switch to the virtual desktop on the left, bottom or right: Windows Key + Ctrl + Left / Right.
Command for opening the app pinned to the taskbar in the position indicated by the number: Windows Key + Number.

Now, go to the the first Virtual Desktop and showing all opened app as showing Virtual Desktop 1.jpg.
Next is the second one as showing Virtual Desktop 2.jpg.
Finally, I capture the third one as showing Virtual Desktop 3.jpg.
